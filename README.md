GCI Task - "Setup Git and a GitHub account - JBoss Community"

## Create an account on GitHub
I already had an account on GitHub, an some simple repositories as well. So, I didn't have problem understanding this Git Version Control service primarily used for open source software code.

## Create a new repository
Here are the details I gave while creating my new repository.

I found that it is really easy and convenient to create new Repositories on GitHub - I made mine in 10 seconds!

## Open a new dummy issue in the repository

I created a new Dummy issue in my repository, and it was real simple. Its really a great way of asking questions about the repo, or making announcements, or suggesting edits! [Here's my issue.](https://github.com/mrigankpawagi/new-repository/issues/1)

## Create a Python / C++ / Java based hello-world program and commit it to the repository

I chose Python as its pretty much simple and easy and fast to implement logic. I created a file `helloWorld.py` and wrote a _Hello World_ Program. Here's the output in IDLE.

I uploaded my file to the repository, and [it can be found here](https://github.com/mrigankpawagi/new-repository/blob/master/helloWorld.py).

## Create a new branch making changes to the hello-world program, and send a pull request to the master branch.

I made some change in my `helloWorld.py` . Here's the new code with output.

Then, I uploaded the file to the repo, and instead of **Committing Changes**, I created a new branch, `Patch` and started a pull request, *and Proposed the Change*. [Here is the new branch](https://github.com/mrigankpawagi/new-repository/tree/patch), [and here's the Pull Request](https://github.com/mrigankpawagi/new-repository/pull/2).

## Add a sample readme to the project.
You are already reading the `README`! :smile:

## Add a LICENSE and a .gitignore file to the repository

I created the `LICENSE` and `.gitignore` files at the time of creating the repo itself. 

 - For the license, I chose `GNU General Public License v3.0` as this sample repository is okay with commercial, patent, private use and modification and distribution.
- For the `.gitignore`, I chose Python, so that my repository doesn't track essential Python files, and Git just ignores them.
